Agaricus blazei is an edible mushroom grown in Brazil and Japan. It is
used to treat arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
dermatitis, and cancer. Laboratory studies and experiments done in
mice have shown that Agaricus can stimulate the immune system and may
have anticancer effects. Compounds present in Agaricus prevent
formation of blood vessels needed for tumor development. There are
case reports showing Agaricus may cause liver damage and death.
